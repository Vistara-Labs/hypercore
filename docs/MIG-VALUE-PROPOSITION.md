# MIG (Multi-Instance GPU) Value Proposition

## Overview

MIG (Multi-Instance GPU) technology, combined with our implementation, unlocks significant value in GPU utilization for AI/ML workloads. Here's a detailed breakdown of what it enables and why it's transformative.

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Dynamic GPU Partitioning 🎯

#### What it Unlocks
- Split a single NVIDIA A100 GPU into up to 7 fully isolated GPU instances
- Each instance has its own high-bandwidth memory partition, cache, and compute cores
- Different partition sizes to match workload requirements (e.g., 3GB, 5GB, 10GB, etc.)

#### Why it's Powerful
- Run multiple different models on the same GPU
- Optimize resource allocation based on model requirements
- Eliminate resource wastage from underutilized GPUs

### 2. Multi-Tenant Efficiency 🏢

#### What it Unlocks
- Run multiple AI models simultaneously on the same physical GPU
- Complete memory and compute isolation between workloads
- Independent scaling of different workloads

#### Why it's Powerful
- Increase GPU utilization from typical 20-30% to 80%+ through multi-tenancy
- Eliminate "noisy neighbor" problems with guaranteed resource allocation
- Enable multiple teams/projects to share expensive GPU resources

### 3. Cost Optimization 💰

#### What it Unlocks
- Reduce cost per workload by up to 75%
- Pay only for the GPU resources you need
- Optimize GPU investment through better utilization

#### Why it's Powerful
- Run 4x more workloads on the same GPU hardware
- Reduce cloud GPU costs significantly
- Make GPU resources accessible for smaller workloads

### 4. Resource Optimization ⚡

#### What it Unlocks
- Dynamic allocation and deallocation of GPU resources
- Automatic scaling based on workload demands
- Real-time monitoring and optimization

#### Why it's Powerful
